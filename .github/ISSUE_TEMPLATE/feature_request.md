A clear and concise description of what can be enhanced, e.g., "I wish I could do [...]"

### Describe your proposed implementation
This should provide a description of the feature request, e.g.:

* "Function `foo` needs a new arguments `bar` to set [...]"
* "Create a new function `foo` to calculate [...]"

If applicable, try to write a docstring for the desired feature. To illustrate, if you would like to add a new function in a module, provide:
* the name of the function
* a description of the task accomplished by the function
* a list of the input and output parameters together with their types (e.g., `int`,
  `str`, `pandas.DataFrame`, etc.) and a short description of its/their meaning

### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant
This should provide a description of any alternative solutions or features you've
considered.

### Additional context

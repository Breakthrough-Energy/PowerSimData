# PowerSimData
**PowerSimData** is part of a Python software ecosystem developed by [Breakthrough
Energy Sciences](https://science.breakthroughenergy.org/) to carry out power flow study
in the U.S. electrical grid.


## Main Features
Here are a few things that **PowerSimData** can do:
* Provide a flexible modeling tool to create complex scenarios
* Perform investment cost studies
* Run power flow study using interface to external simulation engine
* Manage data throughout the lifecycle of a simulation

A detailed tutorial can be found on our [docs].


## Where to get it
* Clone or Fork the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Breakthrough-Energy/PowerSimData)
* Get latest release from PyPi: `pip install powersimdata`


## Dependencies
**PowerSimData** relies on several Python packages all available on
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/). The list can be found in the ***requirements.txt*** or
***Pipfile*** files both located at the root of this package.


## Installation
To take full advantage of our software, we recommend that you clone/fork
**[plug](https://github.com/Breakthrough-Energy/plug)** and follow the information
therein to get our containerized framework up and running. A client/server installation
is also possible and outlined in our [Installation
Guide](https://breakthrough-energy.github.io/docs/user/installation_guide.html). Either
way, you will need a powerful solver, e.g. Gurobi, to run complex scenarios.

Only a limited set of features are available when solely installing **PowerSimData**. If you choose this option, we recommend that you use `pipenv`:
```sh
pipenv sync
pipenv shell
```
since the dependencies will be installed in an isolated environment. It is of course
possible to install the dependencies using the requirements file:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Documentation
[Code documentation][docstrings] in form of Python docstrings along with an overview of
the [package][docs] are available on our [website][website].


## Communication Channels
[Sign up](https://science.breakthroughenergy.org/#get-updates) to our email list and
our Slack workspace to get in touch with us.


## Contributing
All contributions (bug report, documentation, feature development, etc.) are welcome. An
overview on how to contribute to this project can be found in our [Contribution
Guide](https://breakthrough-energy.github.io/docs/dev/contribution_guide.html).
